# Minimal Flask Server

A very basic HTTP server based on Flask for the sake of serving as a quick reference for small projects.

Contains examples for basic things such as handling path arguments, returning HTTP statuses and specific headers and different verbs.

I'll expand as needed :)

## Requirements

``
pip3 install flask
``
